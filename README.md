# README

The Email Parser API is a Ruby on Rails-based application that parses .eml email files to extract JSON data. The JSON content can either be:

Attached as a file in the email.
Linked as a URL in the email body.
This API provides a clean and robust way to process email data, making it ideal for integration with email workflows or automated systems.
